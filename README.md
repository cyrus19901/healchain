A Blockchain enabled decentralized & distributed continuity of care document system primarily connecting all stakeholders in public health system like Hospitals, Clinics, Doctors, Pharmacies and Labs with Patient Data like Admit History, Consultation History, Lab Reports and Prescriptions as the primary assets. Our solution has three components: 1. A blockchain network that stores the details of various participants and data assets and runs various transactions to make changes. 2. Mobile app for patients which connects to blockchain network and display own medical history from various health care providers. 3. A web interface for Doctors, Labs and Pharmacies to create and view health data assets.
